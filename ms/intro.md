# Ant Detective: an Efficient Tool to Automate Ant Counting and Provide a More In-depth Understanding of Ant Foraging Behaviors

## Introduction

Ant foraging behaviors are a critical area of study in entomology, as they provide valuable insights into colony dynamics and pest control. Traditionally, quantifying long-term behaviors and investigating foraging preferences in ants requires labor-intensive manual counting across a large number of images. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, particularly when dealing with large numbers of ants. As a result, scaling up experiments to simulate more natural conditions, such as larger colony sizes and increased numbers of colonies, is challenging. Additionally, the number of ants counted in an image or at a specific time point may not fully capture the complexity of foraging behaviors, which often involve both spatial factors and the interaction between spatial and temporal dynamics, such as testing different sugar concentrations or lure types [cite].

These limitations have impeded the deeper understanding of ant foraging behaviors and the development of more effective pest control strategies. To address these challenges, this study explores the use of computer vision (CV) to automate the counting process and provide a more comprehensive analysis of both the spatial and temporal dimensions of ant foraging behavior. Computer vision enables computers to interpret and analyze visual information, such as images and videos. The study aims to achieve three main objectives: (1) determining the quantity of image data required for the system to generalize to new images under similar or different imaging conditions, (2) examining the systemâ€™s performance in dense imaging scenarios, and (3) investigating how computer vision can enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal aspects of ant foraging behaviors. The source code for generating and evaluating the CV system is available publicly on [GitHub](), and the dataset used in this study can be accessed on [Hugging Face]().
