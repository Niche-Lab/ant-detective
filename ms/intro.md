# Ant Detective: an Efficient Tool to Automate Ant Counting and Provide a More In-depth Understanding of Ant Foraging Behaviors

## Introduction

Ant foraging behaviors are a critical area of study in entomology, as they provide valuable insights into colony dynamics and pest control. Traditionally, quantifying long-term behaviors and investigating foraging preferences in ants requires labor-intensive manual counting across a large number of images. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, particularly when dealing with large numbers of ants. As a result, scaling up experiments to simulate more natural conditions, such as larger colony sizes and increased numbers of colonies, is challenging. Additionally, the number of ants counted in an image or at a specific time point may not fully capture the complexity of foraging behaviors, which often involve both spatial factors and the interaction between spatial and temporal dynamics, such as testing different sugar concentrations or lure types [cite].

These limitations have impeded the deeper understanding of ant foraging behaviors and the development of more effective pest control strategies [cite]. Relevant efforts have been made to automate the process. [2 or 3 strategies and their shortcomings]. 


Detecting small objects like ants is challenging due to several limitations in current computer vision (CV) models, which are typically designed for larger objects that occupy a significant portion of an image. Since ants are small and often densely packed, standard models struggle to identify them accurately. This limitation arises from the architecture of most CV models. For instance, in YOLOv8, input images are first resized to 640 x 640 pixels and then processed through several convolutional layers, resulting in progressively smaller feature maps. The smallest of these feature maps has a spatial dimension of 20 x 20 pixels. This downsampling means that an object smaller than 32 x 32 pixels (calculated by dividing 640 by 20) will be reduced to a single value in the smallest feature map. As a result, the model cannot effectively capture the fine spatial details necessary to distinguish small objects like ants, making accurate detection extremely difficult.


 To address these challenges, this study explores the use of computer vision (CV) to automate the counting process and provide a more comprehensive analysis of both the spatial and temporal dimensions of ant foraging behavior. Computer vision enables computers to interpret and analyze visual information, such as images and videos. The study aims to achieve three main objectives: (1) determining the quantity of image data required for the system to generalize to new images under similar or different imaging conditions, (2) examining the systemâ€™s performance in dense imaging scenarios, and (3) investigating how computer vision can enhance our understanding of the spatial and temporal aspects of ant foraging behaviors. The source code for generating and evaluating the CV system is available publicly on [GitHub](), and the dataset used in this study can be accessed on [Hugging Face]().
