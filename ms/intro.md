# Ant Detective: an Efficient Tool to Automate Ant Counting and Provide a More In-depth Understanding of Ant Foraging Behaviors

## Introduction

[Briefly introducing ant foraging behaviors and their importance in Entomology]. Traditionally, to quantify a long-term behaviors and investigate the foraging preference in ants, it is required to conduct labor-intensive counting manually for a large number of images. Since human counting error is prone to occur when the number of ants is large and the process is time-consuming, it is also challenging to scale up the colony size and the number of colonies, which are essentially more similar to the natural environment. Besides, the counting number per image or time point is not necessarily representative of the foraging behaviors, which usually involve spatial or even the interaction between spatial and temporal aspects. Such as testing a favorable foraging site with different sugar concentrations or lure types [cite]. 

These limitations has hindered the understanding of ant foraging behaviors and the development of effective pest control strategies. To alleviate the challenges, this study investigates the feasibility of deploying a computer vision system to automate the counting process and provide a more in-depth understanding of ant foraging behaviors on both spatial and temporal aspects. Computer vision is generally a technique that enables computers to interpret and understand the visual information (e.g., images or videos). This study aims to address three main objectives: (1) determining the amount of image resources required to generalize the computer system to new images with either the same or different imaging settings, (2) investigating how the system handles dense imaging settings, and (3) exploring how computer vision enables the understanding of spatial and temporal aspects of ant grazing behaviors. The source code of generating and evaluating the CV system is publicly available at [GitHub](). The dataset used in this study is also available at [Hugging Face]().
