# Methods

## Data Collection

[Describe the key characteristics of each image datase]. These images were organized 


(1) determining the amount of image resources required to generalize the computer system to new images with either the same or different imaging settings, (2) investigating how the system handles dense imaging settings, and (3) exploring how computer vision enables the understanding of spatial and temporal aspects of ant grazing behaviors.
